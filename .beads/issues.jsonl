{"id":"vibe-ship-small-vsq","title":"Create Visuals \u0026 Diagrams guide page","description":"Create a new documentation page explaining how visual diagrams provide both high-level structural clarity and low-level execution logic—and why they're easy to generate with LLMs.\n\n## Page Content\n\n### 1. The C4 Model: Architectural Hierarchy\nExplain the C4 model as a 'map' for software architecture that allows zooming in/out depending on audience (CEO vs Lead Developer):\n\n- **Level 1: System Context** - Bird's-eye view showing the system as a single box with interactions to users and external systems (Stripe, AWS, etc.)\n- **Level 2: Containers** - Zooms into the system to show high-level technical building blocks (Web App, Mobile App, Database, File Store)\n- **Level 3: Components** - Zooms into a single container to show internal logical components (Payment Controller, Email Service)\n- **Level 4: Code** - Most granular view (UML class diagrams, ER diagrams). Often omitted in modern agile or auto-generated.\n\n### 2. Task Graphs: Execution Flow\nExplain Task Graphs (Directed Acyclic Graphs / DAGs) for representing operations with dependencies:\n\n- **Parallelism** - Running independent tasks simultaneously\n- **Conditionals** - 'If Task A fails, go to Task C; if succeeds, go to Task B'\n- **Cycles/Loops** - Re-running tasks until conditions are met (common in AI agents that self-correct)\n\nRelate to agentic frameworks like LangGraph and CrewAI.\n\n### 3. Why LLMs Excel at Diagrams\nExplain how LLMs can easily generate Mermaid/PlantUML diagrams from natural language descriptions.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"citadelgrad@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-23T15:45:15.570413-08:00","created_by":"Scott Nixon","updated_at":"2026-01-23T15:46:55.520945-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-23T15:46:55.520945-08:00","close_reason":"Completed: Created comprehensive Visuals \u0026 Diagrams guide at docs/visuals-and-diagrams.md.
